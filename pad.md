Certainly! To organize your Rust code into a more manageable structure, you can break it down into multiple modules and files. Here's a suggested file structure for your chess engine:

```
src/
├── lib.rs
├── board.rs
├── move.rs
├── piece.rs
├── game.rs
└── utils.rs
```

Here's a breakdown of what each file could contain:

- `lib.rs`: The entry point of your library. It will declare all the modules and make them accessible to other parts of your program.
- `board.rs`: Contains the `Board` struct and associated methods for manipulating the chessboard.
- `move.rs`: Contains the `Move` and `ScoredMove` structs and related functionality.
- `piece.rs`: Contains the `PieceType` enum and any related functionality.
- `game.rs`: Contains game logic, such as making and unmaking moves, evaluating the board, and searching for the best moves.
- `utils.rs`: Contains utility functions like `get_rank`, `get_file`, and any other helper functions that don't belong to a specific struct.

Here's how you might start refactoring your code:

1. `lib.rs`:
```rust
// lib.rs
pub mod board;
pub mod piece;
pub mod game;
pub mod utils;
pub mod r#move; // 'move' is a reserved keyword, so we use raw identifier syntax
```

2. `board.rs`:
```rust
// board.rs
use crate::piece::PieceType;
use crate::r#move::Move;
use crate::utils::{get_rank, get_file};

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Board {
    // ... fields ...
}

impl Board {
    // ... methods ...
}
```

3. `move.rs`:
```rust
// move.rs
use crate::piece::PieceType;

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Move {
    // ... fields ...
}

impl Move {
    // ... methods ...
}

pub struct ScoredMove {
    // ... fields ...
}

impl ScoredMove {
    // ... methods ...
}
```

4. `piece.rs`:
```rust
// piece.rs
#[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub enum PieceType {
    // ... variants ...
}
```

5. `game.rs`:
```rust
// game.rs
use crate::board::Board;
use crate::r#move::{Move, ScoredMove};

impl Board {
    // ... game-related methods ...
}
```

6. `utils.rs`:
```rust
// utils.rs
pub fn get_rank(square: u8) -> u8 {
    // ... implementation ...
}

pub fn get_file(square: u8) -> u8 {
    // ... implementation ...
}

// ... other utility functions ...
```

After splitting the code into these files, you can import them back into `board.rs` or any other file where they're needed using `crate::module_name::ItemName`. For example, in `board.rs`, you would import the `Move` struct like this:

```rust
use crate::r#move::Move;
```

And in `game.rs`, you would import the `Board` struct like this:

```rust
use crate::board::Board;
```

Remember to move the relevant code to each file and ensure that all the necessary items are `pub` (public) so they can be accessed from other modules. You may also need to adjust visibility and add `use` statements to resolve any compilation errors due to the refactoring.

This structure should help you organize your code better and make it more maintainable.
